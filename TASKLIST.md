## TO DO List / Done List

- Commented out items are completed:

# Up next feature should control the actual spotify queue

# Maybe using spotifyd on arch linux. It should queue up all

# results from the latest call, and display a list of the queued next

# songs

# I want a suggestion on how to integrate last.fm, what features it should use and how this program should use last.fm

I want feature support for saving playlist, for saving a song to a SpoTuify Playlist. This should create playlists on my actual spotify.

I want the client to be able to skip to next song, startover the song, prev song, and up/down volume.

Integration for chatgpt to break down the lyrics and explain what they mean. Add interesting insight etc. I also want the chatgpt log feed window to be somehow paginated or scrollable.

The large messages should be displayed chunked maybe, as if they are ocming in in real time with the radio.

Longer-term Goal: Add support for different players besides Spotify. Toggleable modules with a set default.
