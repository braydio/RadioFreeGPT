# PLANNED FEATURES AND CURRENT ISSUES

### COMPLETED

- Up next feature should control the actual spotify queue
- Maybe using spotifyd on arch linux. It should queue up all results from the latest call, and display a list of the queued next songs
- Initial integrate last.fm, features to come.

## PLANNED FEATURES

- Feature support for saving playlists, allowing users to save a song directly to their Spotify playlists. This will create playlists on the user's actual Spotify account.

- An option on the menu will be 'suggest' vs 'queue'. This will query chatgpt to respond with a list of song to go with the currently playing song. The user will be able to queue up songs based on the list returned by chatgpt.

- Client functionality will include the ability to skip to the next song, restart the current song, go to the previous song, and adjust the volume up and down.

- Integration of ChatGPT will be implemented to break down lyrics and provide explanations, along with interesting insights. Additionally, a ChatGPT log feed window will be designed to be paginated or scrollable for better user experience.

- Large messages will be displayed in chunks, simulating a real-time streaming experience as if they are appearing in live radio format.

- As a longer-term goal, support for additional music players beyond Spotify will be added, featuring toggleable modules with a defined default setting.

## BUG FIXES to fix
